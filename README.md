# Siracusa Field

The Siracusa Field plugin for Wordpress adds a bunch of styles custom fields to your "edit post" view. They allow for the addition of custom CSS and Javascript to individual posts, either embedded or referenced, or if needed, both.
This functionality was showcased in a recent [Ars Technica post](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/04/after-fifteen-years-ars-says-goodbye-to-john-siracusas-os-x-reviews/) (see screenshot) and I thought it could benefit other blogs as well. I am by no means a Wordpress expert, so feel free to fork or add to this. There are some rough edges here and there.

## Installation

Installation works as with any other WP plugin: simply copy the file to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

## Other

Thank you John Siracusa for many years of (Mac) OS X reviews!

In case Ars Technica ever releases the actual plugin code, let me know and I'll link to it here.
